## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- UL lists
- image overlay (mix-blend-mode)
- absolute/relative positioning
- media queries

### What I learned

Finally find out why Frontend is giving me the desktop width to be 1444px and how to make it work. hahaha

I learnt how to add an overlay to an image. Asked Chat GPT for that. (is there any other solution for this?)

Is using Chat GPT when you don't remeber things a bad habbit? Please note that I use it not for an absolute solution but to induce me a way for the solution I want. 

I feel like I am more confident in finding why my elements are not centering when I want them to be centered.

### Continued development

I would like to know in which order should I write CSS code.

I should learn how to align little items. update: find a way to properly align those stats elements. 

I am struggling with mobile version responsivness and aligning the items. 

I feel like mobile version code looks bad and ugly. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - The poster from here helps me whenever I am confused about centering, justifying and aligning the flexbox items.
